Checkpoint Submission: Due Fri May 9, 2014 @ 8:00 PM
Final Submission: Due Thursday May 15, 2014 @ 11:59 PM

Please read the Assignment Page carefully before starting.

Important Note:
Because you are not required to implement or use BitInputStream and BitOutputStream for the checkpoint, you will either need to remove all
references to them from the provided files (by commenting them out) and edit the Makefile, or create "dummy" versions of these classes
(with both header and implementation files) to get the code to compile.
